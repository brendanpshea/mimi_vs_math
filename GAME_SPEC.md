# Mimi vs. Math — Game Specification

## Overview

Mimi vs. Math is a browser-based, Zelda-style top-down adventure game built with
**JavaScript + Phaser.js**. Mimi the cat explores a whimsical world, encounters enemies,
and defeats them by answering math questions. The game targets **elementary and middle-grade
players (ages 6–13)** and covers addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions,
decimals, and mixed challenge content across five regions.

## Game World & Progression

### Structure

```
Overworld Map
├── Region 0: Sunny Village        (Addition & Subtraction)
├── Region 1: Meadow Maze          (Multiplication)
├── Region 2: Desert Dunes         (Division)
├── Region 3: Frostbite Cavern     (Fractions & Decimals)
└── Region 4: Shadow Castle        (Mixed / Challenge)
```

Each region contains:
- A **procedurally-decorated exploration area**
- **3–5 enemy types** scaled to that region’s math theme
- **1 boss encounter** to unlock the next region
- **2–3 NPCs** who give hints or lore

There are no treasure chests; items are dropped by enemies after battle.

### Overworld

- Top-down, tile-based (16×16 or 32×32 tiles)
- Mimi moves freely; collision detection prevents walking through walls/water
- Camera follows Mimi with soft boundaries
- Regions unlock sequentially; locked region entrances show a padlock until the
  previous boss is defeated

## Player Character: Mimi

### Stats

| Stat | Description |
|---|---|
| HP | 6 hearts (12 HP); displayed as heart icons |
| Speed | Movement speed across the exploration area |

### Items (Enemy Drops)

Items drop at the end of battle (30% chance from regular enemies; 100% from bosses).
The item name and description are shown in the victory overlay.

| Item | Effect |
|---|---|
| Sardine | Restore 2 HP |
| Yarn Ball | +5 seconds added to battle timer (one battle) |
| Catnip | Double damage on next correct answer |
| Lucky Collar | Shield — blocks one hit from an enemy |
| Fish Fossil | Reveal one incorrect choice per question (3 uses) |

### Persistence

- Progress saved to `localStorage` (current region, HP, inventory, defeated bosses, math stats)
- Mimi respawns at the start of the current region's entrance if HP reaches 0 (no permanent game-over)
- **New Game** opens a world-select overlay; choosing a world auto-unlocks all prior bosses
- **Continue** loads the existing save and returns directly to the world map

### Stats Tracking

All math performance data accumulates across the entire save:

| Stat | Description |
|---|---|
| Questions Answered | Total seen across all battles |
| Correct / Incorrect | Raw counts; timeouts count as incorrect |
| Accuracy % | `correct / answered × 100` |
| Avg. Answer Time | Mean ms per answer, converted to seconds for display |
| Best Streak | Longest consecutive correct-answer run |
| Battles Won / Lost | Battle outcomes |
| Perfect Battles | Battles won with zero wrong answers or timeouts |

Stats are viewable from the title screen, the world-select overlay, and the world map.

---

## Exploration (Zelda-style)

- **Movement:** WASD or arrow keys; 4-directional
- **Interaction:** Spacebar or Enter to talk to NPCs / interact with the boss door
- **Pause / back:** Esc returns to overworld or closes the current overlay

---

## Battle System

### Trigger

Walking into an enemy sprite on the map initiates a battle. The screen transitions
to the **battle view** (a distinct UI overlay or scene).

### Turn Structure

Each "turn" presents one math problem:

1. **Problem displayed** — large, centered text (e.g., `7 × 8 = ?`)
2. **Four answer choices** shown as clickable buttons (also keyboard 1–4)
3. **Timer bar** counts down (default: 15 seconds)
4. Outcome:
   - **Correct + fast (< 5 s):** Mimi deals full damage + speed bonus
   - **Correct (5–15 s):** Mimi deals standard damage
   - **Wrong or timeout:** Enemy deals damage to Mimi; correct answer is shown briefly

5. Repeat until one side reaches 0 HP.

### Damage Values (base)

| Outcome | Mimi's damage | Enemy's damage |
|---|---|---|
| Correct (fast) | 3 | — |
| Correct (normal) | 2 | — |
| Wrong / timeout | — | 1–2 (varies by enemy) |

### Enemy HP range

| Enemy tier | HP |
|---|---|
| Common | 4–6 |
| Elite | 8–10 |
| Boss | 20–30 |

### Combo System

- 3 correct answers in a row → "Math Streak!" banner; next correct answer deals +1 damage
- Streak resets on a wrong answer

### Post-battle

- **Victory overlay** shows: accuracy for the battle (`N/N correct, XX%`), streak badge (if ≥3), perfect-battle badge (zero wrong answers), boss-unlock message, and any item dropped.
- **Defeat:** Mimi’s HP is restored to 50% of max; she returns to the region entrance.
- Math stats (`GameState.stats`) are updated on every answer and at battle end.

## Math Content

### Region 1 — Multiplication (grades 4–5)

- Times tables: factors 2–12
- Multi-digit × single-digit (e.g., `23 × 4`)
- Word problems presented as story text above the equation

### Region 2 — Division (grades 4–5)

- Division facts derived from Region 1 tables
- Long division with remainders (quotient only required)
- Division word problems

### Region 3 — Fractions & Decimals (grades 5–6)

- Comparing fractions (which is larger?)
- Adding/subtracting fractions with like & unlike denominators
- Converting fractions ↔ decimals
- Multiplying a fraction by a whole number

### Region 4 — Mixed Challenge (grades 6–7)

- Order of operations (no exponents)
- Percentages (e.g., "What is 30% of 80?")
- Ratio & proportion
- Negative number arithmetic

### Answer Choice Generation

- 1 correct answer
- 3 plausible distractors generated procedurally:
  - Off-by-one errors
  - Common misconception answers (e.g., adding instead of multiplying)
  - Nearby round numbers
